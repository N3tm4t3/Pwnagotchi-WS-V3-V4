## Step 1: Download and Install the Base Image
1. Download the Pwnagotchi base image provided by jayofelony [here](https://github.com/jayofelony/pwnagotchi).
2. Flash the image to your SD card using a tool like [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

## Step 3: Configuration File Setup

 A file called config.toml in /etc/pwnagotchi is responsible for configuring the entire behavior of the Pwnagotchi, including network settings, plugins, display options, and AI learning parameters.

# I have added a config.toml file which you can edit and customize!

VOILA!
Your Pwnagotchi can capture handshakes with enhanced functionality. Enjoy hacking responsibly!
